## Why this blog?

I've been in the tech business for twenty years, almost all my life, I have a degree in engineering, and I work as a dev. 

I am deeply disappointed in this field, not in the technology itself, but in those who use it.

NFTs, crypto, blockchain, LLMs, e-waste, planned obsolescence, mass consumerism dictated by social media, have destroyed the utilitarian concept of technology and the purity of scientific progress in computer science.

I decided to collect my ideas and thoughts about it here, maybe no one is interested, maybe I'll stop writing the day after tomorrow, maybe I'll decide to abandon this area of knowledge and devote myself to agriculture, who knows.

But I write these thoughts, for those like me who are in love with the concept of computer science as it was originally intended, to help man in the processes of life, and not as a mere consumerist object, I love the idea of authentic free software, free as in freedom [Richard Stallman].

For those who pass by, happy reading, for those who disagree, write your own damn blog!
